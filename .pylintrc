# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis. It

# some base class constructors have quite a few arguments

# and due to ClassWithCollections and conditional attributes classes by default have lots
# of attributes

# some sci computation can't be handled efficiently without having
# lots of locals
